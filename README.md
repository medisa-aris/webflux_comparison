# WebFlux Comparison: Imperative vs Reactive Programming

## Overview

This project demonstrates a detailed comparison between **imperative programming** and **reactive programming** using **Spring WebFlux**. The comparison explores performance, scalability, and ease of use between traditional blocking (imperative) and non-blocking (reactive) approaches in modern web applications.

This repository provides both theoretical explanations and practical implementations to give readers a solid understanding of both paradigms and how they apply to the development of reactive applications.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following key sections:

1. **Introduction to Programming Paradigms**
   - An overview of **imperative** and **reactive** programming.
   - Key concepts: blocking vs non-blocking, synchronous vs asynchronous.

2. **Understanding WebFlux**
   - Introduction to **Spring WebFlux**: A non-blocking, reactive framework built on **Project Reactor**.
   - Comparison with traditional Spring MVC.

3. **Implementation of Sample Applications**
   - **Imperative Application**: Using Spring MVC for traditional blocking I/O.
   - **Reactive Application**: Using Spring WebFlux for non-blocking, asynchronous processing.

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmarks and stress tests comparing the performance of imperative vs reactive applications under various loads.
   - Metrics: Response time, throughput, resource utilization.

5. **Scalability Analysis**
   - How reactive programming with WebFlux handles concurrency and high traffic.
   - Comparison of scalability between imperative and reactive applications.

6. **Code Examples**
   - Full implementations for both imperative and reactive applications.
   - Configuration and setup instructions.

7. **Summary and Conclusion**
   - Key takeaways about when to use reactive programming and WebFlux.
   - Trade-offs in terms of complexity, scalability, and performance.
